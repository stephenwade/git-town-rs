# git-town-rs

[Git Town](https://github.com/git-town/git-town) is a fantastic tool that makes Git workflows easier. It's written in Go.

I want to learn Rust. I'm going to try to rewrite Git Town using Rust.

This is intended as a learning experience for me. I'll learn plenty along the way, and I might even get a working project at the end! I'm not doing this with the intent that the official Git Town project be rewritten in Rust, although if that happens at the end I would be delighted.
